# Lox - A Lightweight Programming Language
This repo contains two implementations of an interpreter for a programming language named Lox.

The specs of the language and structure of the interpreters are based on those described by Robert Nystrom in his book _Crafting Interpreters_. 
However, these implementations also contain extensions due to the addition of some more advanced functionality as well as restructuring and refactoring to better conform to design principles and personal preferences.
